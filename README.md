# nn-image-generation
This assignment was completed as part of my master's in AI at NUIG.<br>
The project uses neural networks to generate image data.<br>
More specifcally, Images of handwriting are generated using an Autoecnoder, a Variational Autoencoder and a Generative Adversarial Network.<br><br>
